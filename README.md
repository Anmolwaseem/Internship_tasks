Internship Tasks

This repository contains the internship tasks I worked on, focusing on practical applications of data analysis and machine learning. 
Each task is implemented in Python using Pandas,
 NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Task 1: Titanic Dataset Analysis

Objective: Analyze the Titanic dataset to identify survival patterns.

Steps Performed:

Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, categorical encoding).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): relationships between survival and passenger attributes.

Visualizations using bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

Built a Logistic Regression model to predict survival.

Outcome: Understood which factors most influenced survival and created a working predictive model.

Task 2: Sentiment Analysis

Objective: Build a text classification model to identify sentiment in reviews.

Steps Performed:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).

Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.

Trained a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluated results using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Outcome: Learned the fundamentals of NLP pipelines and developed a model that classifies reviews into positive or negative sentiment.

Task 3: Fraud Detection

Objective: Detect fraudulent transactions from a financial dataset.

Steps Performed:

Explored dataset to understand transaction patterns.

Balanced the dataset using resampling techniques.

Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score (important for fraud detection).

Outcome: Built a machine learning workflow to identify potential fraud cases with higher accuracy and recall.

Task 4: House Price Prediction

Objective: Predict house prices using regression techniques.

Steps Performed:

Loaded and cleaned the Boston Housing dataset.

Analyzed feature correlations with price.

Built regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).

Evaluated with metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score.

Outcome: Developed a predictive model that estimates house prices based on multiple features.
