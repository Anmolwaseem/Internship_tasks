Internship Tasks

This repository contains the internship tasks I worked on, focusing on practical applications of data analysis and machine learning.
Each task is implemented in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Task 1: Titanic Dataset Analysis

Objective: Analyze the Titanic dataset to identify survival patterns.

Steps Performed:

Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, categorical encoding).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): relationships between survival and passenger attributes.

Visualizations using bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

Built a Logistic Regression model to predict survival.

Outcome: Understood which factors most influenced survival and created a working predictive model.

Task 2: Sentiment Analysis

Objective: Build a text classification model to identify sentiment in reviews.

Steps Performed:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).

Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.

Trained a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluated results using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Outcome: Learned the fundamentals of NLP pipelines and developed a model that classifies reviews into positive or negative sentiment.

Task 3: Fraud Detection

Objective: Detect fraudulent transactions from a financial dataset.

Steps Performed:

Explored dataset to understand transaction patterns.

Balanced the dataset using resampling techniques.

Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score (important for fraud detection).

Outcome: Built a machine learning workflow to identify potential fraud cases with higher accuracy and recall.

Task 4: House Price Prediction

Objective: Predict house prices using regression techniques.

Steps Performed:

Loaded and cleaned the Boston Housing dataset.

Analyzed feature correlations with price.

Built regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).

Evaluated with metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score.

Outcome: Developed a predictive model that estimates house prices based on multiple features.

Task 5: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing)

Objective: Predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit as a result of a marketing campaign.

Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Instructions:

Load and explore the dataset.

Encode all categorical features properly.

Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Evaluate the models using Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, and ROC Curve.

Use SHAP or LIME to explain at least 5 model predictions.

Skills Gained:

Classification modeling

Feature encoding

Model interpretability (Explainable AI - XAI)

Customer behavior analysis

Task 6: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

Objective: Cluster customers based on spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each segment.

Dataset: Mall Customers Dataset

Instructions:

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Apply K-Means Clustering to segment customers.

Use PCA or t-SNE to visualize the clusters.

Suggest relevant marketing strategies for each identified segment.

Skills Gained:

Unsupervised learning (K-Means)

Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

Customer segmentation

Strategy development based on data insights

Task 7: Interactive Business Dashboard in Streamlit

Objective: Develop an interactive dashboard for analyzing sales, profit, and segment-wise performance.

Dataset: Global Superstore Dataset

Instructions:

Clean and prepare the dataset.

Build a Streamlit dashboard with filters (Region, Category, Sub-Category).

Display key performance indicators (KPIs) using charts:

Total Sales

Profit

Top 5 Customers by Sales

Skills Gained:

Business Intelligence (BI) dashboarding

Data storytelling

User interactivity with Streamlit

Visual KPI analysis
